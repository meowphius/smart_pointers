<p>Access types in Ada have been designed in a way to prevent the occurrence
of dangling references, i.e. they can never designate objects that have
gone out of scope. There remains however one problem:
When Unchecked_Deallocation is used in order to reclaim storage, we might
access already freed storage or, even worse, storage occupied by new
objects of different types, unless utmost care is taken (this is the very
reason why the generic is called &quot;unchecked&quot; deallocation).
Reference counted pointers prevent these problems.</p>

<p>Also see <a href="Safe_Pointers.html">Safe Pointers</a>, an alternative
implementation.</p>

<!-- ==================================================================== -->

<h3 align="center"><font color="#800000"><a name="Basic">The Basic Package</a></font></h3>

<p>In the following, a package providing a reference-counted access type
Smart_Pointer will be presented that avoids this problem.
References to allocated data item are counted and allocations are
automatically reclaimed when no more references exist, i.e. a user of
this package need not care about storage deallocation, and indeed,
the interface disables direct deallocation.
(But beware of isolated cyclic pointer islands.)</p>

<p>The design follows closely the
<a href="http://www.adacore.com/adaanswers/gems/gem-97-reference-counting-in-ada-part-1">
AdaCore Gem #97</a> and improves the implementation in a way that is the
theme of <a href="http://www.adacore.com/adaanswers/gems/gem-107-preventing-deallocation-for-reference-counted-types/">
AdaCore Gem #107</a>.</p>

<p>Our smart pointers</p>

<pre>  <b>type</b> Smart_Pointer <b>is private</b>;</pre>

<p>store any data derived from</p>

<pre>  <b>type</b> Client_Data <b>is abstract tagged private</b>;</pre>

<p>We allocate a new data item with Set:</p>

<pre>  <b>procedure</b> Set (Self:<b> in out</b> Smart_Pointer; Data: <b>in</b> Client_Data'Class);</pre>

<p>Smart_Pointer is a controlled type which references, beside the client
data, a counter counting the number of all pointers that currently
reference the same data. Thus a call of Set will first clean up its
reference: If there is a data item (after declaration, a smart pointer
points to nothing - it is null), it decreases the counter by one, since
it will no longer grant access to the data. If this was the only pointer
accessing the data, the counter will now be zero and the data can safely
be deallocated. Then a new item will be allocated holding the data and a
counter with value 1.
(See the <a href="http://www.adacore.com/adaanswers/gems/gem-97-reference-counting-in-ada-part-1">
AdaCore Gem #97</a> for the details.)</p>

<p>We could read and write the data with a getter:</p>

<pre>  <b>function</b> Get (Self: Smart_Pointer) <b>return access</b> Client_Data'Class;</pre>

<p>Let's give an example:</p>

<pre>  <b>type</b> My_Data <b>is new</b> Client_Data <b>with record</b>
    I: Integer;
  <b>end record</b>;

  Set (P, My_Data'(Client_Data <b>with</b> I =&gt; -10));

  My_Data (Get (P).<b>all</b>).I := 42;</pre>

<p><code>Get (P)</code> would return an access to Client_Data; thus,
in order to access the actual data, here the integer component I, the
access value has to be dereferenced and a view conversion to My_Data done,
which will incur a tag check that will succeed in this example.
In general, you have to know the type with which to view-convert in order
to access the relevant components.</p>

<p>This is all as in the Gem #97.</p>

<p>However this naive implementation of Get is very dangerous, since the
caller might hold onto the returned pointer forever &ndash; long after the
package has freed the data.
More generally, the package can't know how long they are using the returned
pointer, so it can't know if it is safe to free the associated data.
Continuing the example above:</p>

<pre><span><!-- no font inside without span, why? //-->  <b>declare</b>
    Obj: <b>access</b> Client_Data'Class := Get (P);
  <b>begin</b>
    My_Data (Obj.<b>all</b>).I := 2012;                  -- <i>No problem.</i>
    Set (P, My_Data'(Client_Data <b>with</b> I =&gt; 83));  -- <i>Frees the original object,</i>
                                                  -- <i>because the reference count</i>
                                                  -- <i>is zero after this operation.</i>
    <font color="#FF0000">My_Data (Obj.<b>all</b>).I := 95;                    -- <i>Oops - writing freed memory!</i></font>
  <b>end</b>;</span></pre>

<p>(A minor danger is that the caller might be tempted to free the data
via the pointer, which is none of his business and should completely remain
under control of the package, and thus create dangling pointers.
But people aren't likely to free stuff they didn't create.)</p>

<p>We thus direly need a safe access, which we will
<a href="smart_pointers.ads.html" name="back">construct</a> now.
(See the <a href="http://www.adacore.com/adaanswers/gems/gem-107-preventing-deallocation-for-reference-counted-types/">
AdaCore Gem #107</a>.)</p>

<p>So instead of returning a direct access to the data, we define an
accessor, a limited type with such an access as a discriminant, and let
Get return such an object:</p>

<pre>  <b>type</b> Accessor (Data: <b>access</b> Client_Data'Class) <b>is limited private</b>;
  <b>function</b>  Get (Self: Smart_Pointer) <b>return</b> Accessor;</pre>

<p>Making the type limited prevents copying, and access discriminants are
unchangeable.
The discriminant also cannot be copied to a variable of a named access type.
The result is that the discriminant can be used only for reading and
writing the object (and also not for deallocation).
Thus we have achieved our goal of making accesses safe.</p>

<p>To show how to implement Get, we give the private definition of our
smart pointers:</p>

<pre>  <b>type</b> Client_Data <b>is abstract tagged record</b>
    Count: Natural := 1;  -- <i>the reference count</i>
  <b>end record</b>;

  <b>type</b> Accessor (Data: <b>access</b> Client_Data'Class) <b>is limited null record</b>;

  <b>type</b> Client_Data_Ptr <b>is access</b> Client_Data'Class;

  <b>type</b> Smart_Pointer <b>is new</b> Ada.Finalization.Controlled <b>with record</b>
    Pointer: Client_Data_Ptr;
  <b>end record</b>;</pre>

<p>The implementation of the function Get is quite straight forward:</p>

<pre>  <b>function</b> Get (Self: Smart_Pointer) <b>return</b> Accessor <b>is
  begin
    return</b> Accessor'(Data =&gt; Self.Pointer);
  <b>end</b> Get;</pre>

<p>Alas, we are not yet completely safe. To see this, we have to consider
in detail the lifetime of the Accessor objects.
Let's return to the example above, now with the accessor:</p>

<pre>  My_Data (Get (P).Data.<b>all</b>).I := 42;</pre>

<p>Here, the lifetime of <code>Get (P)</code> ends with the statement and
the accessor is finalized, i.e. it ceases to exist (in Ada vernacular, the
master of the object is the statement).
So tasking issues aside, nothing can happen to the accessed object (the
integer in our example) while the accessor exists.</p>

<p>Now consider a variant of the above.
Imagine we have a pointer P whose reference count is 1, and let's extend
the accessor's lifetime, like we did for the pointer before:</p>

<pre><span><!-- no font inside without span, why? //-->  <b>declare</b>
    A: Accessor <b>renames</b> Get (P);
  <b>begin</b>
    Set (P, ...);  -- <i>allocate a new object</i>
    <font color="#FF0000">My_Data (A.Data.all).I := 42;  -- <i>?</i></font>
  <b>end</b>;  -- <i>A's lifetime ends here</i></span></pre>

<p>In this example, the master of the accessor is the block (and there are
other ways to make the lifetime as long as one wishes).
Now in the block, the pointer P is given a new object to access.
Since we said that P was the only pointer to the old object, it's finalized
just as with the pointer before and again with the same disastrous effect:
<code>A.Data</code> is now a dangling pointer granting access to a
nonexistent object until the end of the declare block.</p>

<p>To cure the situation, we have to prevent the deallocation.
That suggests increasing the reference count with the construction of an
accessor and decreasing the count when the accessor is finalized again.
The easiest way to accomplish this is to piggyback upon the properties of
the smart pointer type:</p>

<pre>  <b>type</b> Accessor (Data: <b>access</b> Client_Data'Class) <b>is limited record</b>
    Hold: Smart_Pointer;
  <b>end record</b>;

  <b>function</b> Get (Self: Smart_Pointer) <b>return</b> Accessor <b>is
  begin
    return</b> Accessor'(Data =&gt; Self.Pointer, Hold =&gt; Self);
  <b>end</b> Get;</pre>

<p>Note by the way that when the discriminant is declared
<b>access constant</b>, the accessor object can be used only for reading
the data.</p>

<!-- ==================================================================== -->

<h4 align="center"><font color="#800000"><a name="Dispatching">Dispatching</a></font></h4>

<p>Above, we saw that a type conversion is necessary for accessing the data.
This is impractical since you have to know which type the smart pointer
references, and this information might not be available (e.g. when retrieving
pointers from a polymorphous list).
Hence a better way is access via dispatching.</p>

<p>Here is the visible package specification for ease of discussion:</p>

<pre><b>package</b> Smart_Pointers <b>is

  type</b> Client_Data <b>is abstract tagged private</b>;

  <b>type</b> Accessor (Data: <b>access</b> Client_Data'Class) <b>is limited private</b>;

  <b>type</b> Smart_Pointer <b>is private</b>;

  <b>procedure</b> Set (Self: <b>in out</b> Smart_Pointer; Data: <b>in</b> Client_Data'Class);
  <b>function</b>  Get (Self: Smart_Pointer) <b>return</b> Accessor;

<b>private</b>

  ...  -- <i>not shown</i>

<b>end</b> Smart_Pointers;</pre>

<p>A user's package might look like so:</p>

<pre><b>with</b> Smart_Pointers;
<b>use</b>  Smart_Pointers;

<b>package</b> My_Pointers <b>is

  type</b> Int_Data <b>is new</b> Client_Data <b>with record</b>
    I: Integer;
  <b>end record</b>;

  <b>not overriding procedure</b> Work (X: <b>in out</b> Int_Data);

  <b>type</b> Flt_Data <b>is new</b> Client_Data <b>with record</b>
    F: Float;
  <b>end record</b>;

  <b>not overriding procedure</b> Work (X: <b>in out</b> Flt_Data);

<b>end</b> My_Pointers;</pre>

<p>The idea is to use a dispatching call to <code>Work</code> instead
of a type conversion:</p>

<pre>  Work (Int_Data (Get (P).Data.all));  -- <i>will raise Constraint_Error if Tag_Check fails</i>
  Work (Get (P).Data.all);             -- <i>meant to dispatch</i></pre>

<p>The first call is statically bound with the type conversion, just
as in the original example.
However, the second call is illegal because of a type mismatch.
For dispatching to work properly, we have to derive our data types from
a common ancestor which has a primitive operation <code>Work</code>:</p>

<pre>  <b>type</b> My_Root <b>is abstract new</b> Client_Data <b>with null record</b>;
  <b>not overriding procedure</b> Work (X: <b>in out</b> My_Root) <b>is abstract</b>;

  <b>type</b> Int_Data <b>is new</b> My_Root <b>with record</b> ...;  -- <i>and similarly for Flt_Data</i>
  <b>overriding procedure</b> Work (X: <b>in out</b> Int_Data);</pre>

<p>Now the dispatching call looks like this:</p>

<pre>  Work (My_Root'Class (Get (P).Data.<b>all</b>));</pre>

<p>and, depending on the tag, the correct version of procedure
<code>Work</code> will be called.
(Note that we still have to do a type conversion, but in this case, it is
a view conversion to the <i>parent's</i> class <code>My_Root'Class</code>,
which  will always pass as long as all further types are derived from
<code>My_Root</code>.)</p>

<p>As a concluding question: Why don't we equip <code>Client_Data</code>
with an abstract procedure <code>Work</code>?
Well, who knows how the Smart_Pointers package will be used - and such
a procedure will have to be overridden for all derived types, which will
be irritating if there is no use for it.
Of course, we could make it a null procedure, but the irritating fact
remains that it might not be useful for the application at hand.</p>

<!-- ==================================================================== -->

<h3 align="center"><font color="#800000"><a name="Genericity">Genericity and Concurrency</a></font></h3>

<p>For simplicity of discussion, the package <code>Smart_Pointers</code> has
been presented as a library package.
This has the effect that derivations from <code>Client_Data</code> have to
be made also on library level (as shown in the examples above).</p>

<p>Since this is impractical, the package in reality is generic and
accordingly called <code>Generic_Smart_Pointers</code>.
It may thus be instantiated at any level; any type derivations have to be
made on the same level.
See the test programs for examples.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the code works fine only in sequential environments or as
long as each data item is handled by exactly one task.
In order to make it task-safe, the manipulation of the reference counter
has to be protected.</p>

<p>However, since task safety is not always needed and protection is time
consuming, a generic parameter package <code>Counters</code> enables you
choosing between a tasksafe and a sequential variant:</p>

<pre><b>generic</b>
  <b>with package</b> Counters <b>is new</b> Generic_Counters (<>);
<b>package</b> Generic_Smart_Pointers <b>is</b>
  ...  -- <i>visible specification as before</i></pre>

<p>where <code>Generic_Counters</code> is a so-called generic signature
package with only generic parameters and an empty specification:</p>

<pre><b>generic
  type</b> Counter <b>is limited private</b>;
  <b>with procedure</b> Increase (This: <b>in out</b> Counter) <b>is</b> <>;
  <b>with procedure</b> Decrease (This: <b>in out</b> Counter; is_Zero: <b>out</b> Boolean) <b>is</b> <>;
<b>package</b> Generic_Counters <b>is
end</b> Generic_Counters;</pre>

<p>Instantiate <code>Generic_Counters</code> with either
<code>Safe_Counters</code> (implemented by a protected object; this is why
the counter has to be limited) for a concurrent environment or
<code>Simple_Counters</code> (implemented by a pure number) for a sequential
environment and use this instance as the generic actual for instantiating
<code>Generic_Smart_Pointers</code>.
Both packages have the same visible specification:</p>

<pre><b>package</b> Safe/Simple_Counters <b>is</b>

  <b>type</b> Counter <b>is limited private</b>;  -- <i>non-negative and properly initialized</i>

  <b>procedure</b> Increase (This: <b>in out</b> Counter) <b>with</b> Inline;
  <b>procedure</b> Decrease (This: <b>in out</b> Counter; is_Zero: <b>out</b> Boolean) <b>with</b> Inline;

<b>private</b>

  ...  -- <i>Rest not shown</i>

<b>end</b> Safe/Simple_Counters;</pre>

<p>The reference count in <code>Client_Data</code> is accordingly replaced
by:</p>

<pre>  <b>type</b> Client_Data <b>is abstract tagged record</b>
    Count: Counter_Ptr := <b>new</b> Counters.Counter;
  <b>end record</b>;</pre>

<!-- ==================================================================== -->

<h3 align="center"><font color="#800000"><a name="Child">Child Packages</a></font></h3>

<p>As you have seen, you have to derive from Client_Data and thus have to know
the specific type of the data accessed or use dispatching in order to access
it again via a view conversion.
Since this is awkward, two child packages with identical interfaces have been
constructed on top of the above which hide all these details by being generic
with respect to the data type they can access, one for definite and one for
<font color="#00BB00">indefinite</font> types:</p>

<pre><span><b>generic

  type</b> T <font color="#00BB00">(&lt;&gt;)</font> <b>is private</b>;

<b>package</b> Generic_Smart_Pointers.Generic_<font color="#00BB00">In</font>Definite_Pointers <b>is

  type</b> Accessor (Data: <b>access</b> T) <b>is limited private</b>;

  <b>type</b> Smart_Pointer <b>is private</b>;

  <b>procedure</b> Set (Self: <b>in out</b> Smart_Pointer; Data: <b>in</b> T);
  <b>function</b>  Get (Self: Smart_Pointer) <b>return</b> Accessor;

  ...  -- <i>Rest not shown</i>

<b>end</b> Generic_Smart_Pointers.Generic_<font color="#00BB00">In</font>Definite_Pointers;</span></pre>

<!-- ==================================================================== -->

<h3 align="center"><font color="#800000"><a name="2012">Ada 2012</a></font></h3>

<p>Ada 2012 alleviates dereferences of the Accessor with the new aspect
<code>Implicit_Dereference</code>:</p>

<pre><span>  <b>type</b> Accessor (Data: <b>access</b> T) <b>is limited private <font color="#00BB00">with</font></b>
    <font color="#00BB00">Implicit_Dereference =&gt; Data</font>;</span></pre>

<p>Accessor is called a <i>reference type</i> (see RM 2012 4.1.5; see also
<a href="http://www.adacore.com/adaanswers/gems/gem-123-implicit-dereferencing-in-ada-2012/">AdaCore Gem #123</a>).
This aspect allows you to write:</p>

<pre><span>  <b>declare</b>
    A: Accessor := Get (P);  -- <i>a reference object</i>
    X: T        := ...;
  <b>begin</b>
    <font color="#00BB00">A           := X;        -- <i>Assignment through a reference is equivalent to</i></font>
    A.Data.all  := X;
    <font color="#00BB00">X           := Get (P);  -- <i>Implicit dereference is equivalent to</i></font>
    X           := Get (P).Data.all;
  <b>end</b>;</span></pre>

<p>Note that now the call of <code>Get (P)</code> is overloaded &ndash; it can
denote the reference object or the data it references, the compiler will
select the correct interpretation depending on context.
Unfortunately this does not work for the basic package because of the needed
type conversion in the dereference, which does not provide enough context
for overload resolution.</p>
